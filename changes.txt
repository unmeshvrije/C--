Algo 2
POST(S) is not part of locals 
We use Java's default random number generator to permutate the post's

ThreadState
WAITING state is now called DONE (meaning that thread is DONE with task and WAITING for new)


@ : apen staartje / Monkey tail / at the rate

# things to do
Use of annotations
Dont call new Random() inside
Make Java threads actually run on separate processors/cores (Use prun in test)

# Algo of Master worker

Master()
{
  Create tasks ,say T tasks
  and we have N threads

  N == T : easiest to implement
  N > T : Some threads will be idle

  N < T : All threads will have work and work queue will be full
          Master should wait for any thread to ask for next job
}
