Algo 2
POST(S) is not part of locals 
We use Java's default random number generator to permutate the post's

ThreadState
WAITING state is now called DONE (meaning that thread is DONE with task and WAITING for new)


@ : apen staartje / Monkey tail / at the rate

# things to do
Use of annotations
Dont call new Random() inside
Make Java threads actually run on separate processors/cores (Use prun in test)


Possible optimizations
 Grab  global lock on both - redState Mapping and StateCounts
 Grab separate locks on these data structures.
 Use something like fine grain locking!


Permutations:
  Without randomness: Generate some sequences. and compare with randomizing
  the post()


Avoiding the blue nodes ?
Difficult to implement correctly: Threads also share the blue state
and other threads may not work with this node.
----Can use hash code to identify the states uniquely
